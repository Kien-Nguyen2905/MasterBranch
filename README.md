1>Propose a data structure to use for this screen. How the backend should return data
to you. Please explain why you choose this structure?
The backend should return data in the following format:
{
"events": [
{
"id": "1", => A unique identifier for each event.
"title": "Doctor Appointment", => The name of the event
"startTime": "2024-09-10T09:00:00Z", => date start
"endTime": "2024-09-10T10:00:00Z", => date end
"date": "2024-09-10", => The specific date of the event
"eventType": "appointment", => Differentiates between appointments and events
"isRecurring": false, => Boolean indicating whether the event repeats
},
]
}
